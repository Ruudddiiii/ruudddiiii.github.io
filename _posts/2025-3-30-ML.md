## Data Filtering and Exploration

Iâ€™ve been working with several datasets from the [ISLR book](https://www.statlearning.com), like the classic [College.csv](https://www.statlearning.com/s/College.csv).

You can also download a local copy here:  
[Download college.csv](../assets/datasets/college.csv)

### ðŸ”¹ Load and Preview the Data

    import pandas as pd

    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv("college.csv")

    # Display shape and first few rows
    print(df.shape)
    print(df.head())

### ðŸ”¹ Filter Private Colleges with High Grad Rates

    # Ensure Grad.Rate is numeric
    df['Grad.Rate'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Grad.Rate'], errors='coerce')

    # Filter data
    high_grad = df[(df['Private'] == 'Yes') & (df['Grad.Rate'] > 80)]
    print(high_grad[['Private', 'Grad.Rate']])

### ðŸ”¹ Visualize Room & Board Costs

    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    sns.boxplot(x='Private', y='Room.Board', data=df)
    plt.title("Room & Board Costs by College Type")
    plt.show()
