## 📊 Data Filtering and Exploration

I’ve been working with several datasets from the [ISLR book](https://www.statlearning.com), like the classic [College.csv](https://www.statlearning.com/s/College.csv).

📁 You can also download a local copy here:

### 🔹 Load and Preview the Data

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("college.csv")

# Display shape and first few rows
print(df.shape)
print(df.head())
