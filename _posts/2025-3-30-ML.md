## 📊 Data Filtering and Stuff

I have worked on several datasets, including the [College.csv](../assets/datasets/college.csv) from the *ISLR* book.

📁 [Download college.csv](../assets/datasets/college.csv)

You can use pandas to load and explore it:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("college.csv")

# Check the shape and head
print(df.shape)
print(df.head())
